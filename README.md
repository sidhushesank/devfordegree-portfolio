# 🚀 DevForDegree — Engineering Projects, Reimagined

> Build. Deploy. Present. Defend.  
> A cinematic, conversion-focused engineering platform built to help students create real-world systems and succeed in academics and industry.

## Vision & Philosophy

DevForDegree was created with a simple philosophy:

Most engineering students don’t fail because of lack of intelligence.  
They fail because they never build real systems.

DevForDegree exists to bridge the gap between academic theory and industry-grade implementation.

This is not a project-selling website.  
This is a system that creates confident engineers.

## Problem Statement

- Students copying projects from YouTube

- One-on-one mentoring
- Industry-grade implementations
- Real portfolio outcomes

Folder structure:

src/
components/
hero/        → 3D hero system  
services/    → Service offerings  
projects/    → Portfolio showcase  
process/     → How it works  
quote/       → Brand messaging  
trust/       → Testimonials  
start/       → Lead capture system  

data/  
servicesData.js  

App.jsx  
main.jsx  

This structure allows:
- Easy scaling
- Component reuse
- Clean separation of concerns
